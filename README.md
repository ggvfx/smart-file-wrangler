## Optional ffmpeg support

Smart File Wrangler works without any external dependencies.

If ffmpeg is available on the system, the tool can extract additional video and audio metadata (such as duration and resolution) and generate video thumbnails.

If ffmpeg is not installed, these features are skipped automatically, and the core file organisation and reporting features continue to work normally.
